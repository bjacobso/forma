# @formalang/host

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0b72bb2: Add RFC 0002 stage 2 compile-time modules. Files can import and export forms and
  macros with private helpers kept in their defining scope, select an isolated
  project prelude, and export declaration identity, schema metadata, and pure
  compile-time data with provenance through portable interfaces. Core forms such
  as `type`, `service`, and `do!` stay built in.
- 09642e5: Type host builtins in editor analysis and keep types around a type error. `analyzeEditor` accepts the `hostBuiltins` and `typePolicy` that `typecheck` does, or takes them from `sessionId`'s session, so a call to a host builtin is typed by its `typeScheme` instead of failing as unbound. Editor analysis now reports every top-level form that does not type, and still types the other forms: a definition that fails is anything to its users, and one failing definition no longer leaves the definitions next to it untyped. Typed spans are resolved with everything inference learned, so a lambda's parameters show their types instead of type variables. `Lsp.analyzeLsp` gains `inferOptions`, `inferProgram` gains an opt-in `onFormError`, and `Engine.typeInferOptions` is exported.
- bdc817d: Add isolated file modules, host-owned relative resolution, explicit imports and exports, portable checked interfaces, and linked Effect TypeScript. Source loading no longer publishes bindings to other files. Re-exports preserve owning type and binding identities; generated files use real imports and exports.
- 22c549f: Add id-addressed structural edit scripts. `@formalang/ts/editor` exports the `EditScript` Effect Schema, `decodeEditScript`, `editScriptJsonSchema` for structured model output, `describeNodes` for the context a model or preview needs, and `applyEditScript`, which applies `replace`, `insert`, `delete`, `wrap`, `splice`, `unwrap`, `raise`, `move`, scope-aware `rename`, and `extract` operations atomically, keeps the author's layout, and returns the new source with a reconciled identity, a change list, and before and after text for each affected form. `TsLanguageHost` implements the optional `applyEditScript`, `describeNodes`, and `editScriptSchema` host methods.
- 1e93832: Add slot affordances for editors. `formSlots` in `@formalang/ts/editor` finds the innermost descriptor-registered form at a position or node and reports its identifiers and slots: which are present (with their values' node ids and spans), empty, missing, or repeatable, the slot the position is in, keyword lists that name no slot, and an edit-script insertion with template text such as `(:trigger )` for each, so an editor can render placeholders such as `+ trigger`. `TsLanguageHost` implements the optional `formSlots` host method, using `define-form`s from the session's sources.
- d950a22: Add opt-in per-expression observation. `evaluate` and `evaluateInSession` accept `observe` and return `observations`: for each author-written expression that ran, its node id and span, evaluation count, last value, and any failure raised there, also when the evaluation fails. The VM gains an `OBSERVE` instruction emitted only for observed evaluations, the expander records the author-written origin of every rebuilt node (`sourceOriginsOf`) so values computed inside macro expansions map back to the call and its arguments, and the host bounds records, collection items, depth, and string length. In a session, `retainValues: "all"` gives each observed value a `valueRef`.
- d47da26: Add an outline codec for structural editors. `sourceToOutline` in `@formalang/ts/syntax` reads source as rows in the style of indentation-sensitive Lisp (SRFI 119): a row's text holds the leading elements of its list and its children hold the rest, comments are rows, multi-line literals stay whole, and broken text becomes rows with errors instead of failing. `outlineToSource` prints rows line for line, reuses the base document's layout for unchanged rows so reading and printing a source with itself as base is exact, gives every printed row's node the row's id, and can comment out rows that do not read. `TsLanguageHost` implements the optional `sourceToOutline` and `outlineToSource` host methods.
- 4662c76: Add a symbol index for editors. `indexSymbols` in `@formalang/ts/editor` returns definitions and references with node ids and spans for one or more documents. It resolves programs after macro expansion, so definitions made by macros are found and macro temporaries are not, handles `define`, `fn`, `let`, `do!`, `match`, `catch`, types, typeclasses, services, and operations, and uses descriptors (including `define-form`s in the indexed documents) for domain forms. `findReferences` returns a symbol's definition and references. `TsLanguageHost` implements the optional `symbolIndex` and `findReferences` host methods, including a session's loaded sources.
- e10e2b5: Add stable node identity for structural editors. `@formalang/ts/syntax` exports `identifySyntax`, which gives every syntax node and line comment an id, and `reconcileSyntax`, which carries ids to a new version of a document: nodes keep their ids when edits happen elsewhere, when they are retyped in place, and when they move with identical tokens. The trivia-preserving lexer now turns unterminated strings and unexpected characters into error nodes instead of throwing, so `parse` always returns a tree. `TsLanguageHost` implements the new optional `identifySyntax` host method.

### Patch Changes

- 30d7db4: Add `elaborateProgram` to `@formalang/ts/descriptor`. It elaborates a whole DSL source against a bootstrapped prelude and returns JSON payloads shaped as packageable declarations, with spans that include end lines and columns, plus structured diagnostics for parse errors, unknown or unsupported forms, duplicate declarations, missing identifiers and required slots, and construct failures. Also adds `elaborateProgramOrThrow`, `ElaborationFailure`, `formatDiagnostic`, `declarationDiagnostic`, `sourceLocator`, `toJsonValue`, and `isJsonRuntimeStringLiteral`. Engine and host diagnostics accept the new `"elaborate"` phase.
- bb9ad6a: Analyze imported modules with caller-located types, retain partial editor types,
  and resolve definitions through named imports, namespaces, and re-exports while
  keeping private globals lexical. Imported VM closures now retain their defining
  compilation's global and builtin tables across calls.
